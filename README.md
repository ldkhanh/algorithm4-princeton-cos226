## Target
In coursera, I found the quiz part has worst experience.

so I decide to try my best to make up for this deficiency. 

Every Quiz problem, I will build a class and a test to verify the correctness.

## List
- [x] Week 1: union find (all 3 quiz, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score with bonus; Aggregate score: 101.25%)
- [x] Week 1: analysis of alogorithm (all 3 quiz)
- [x] Week 2: stack queue (all 3 quiz, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score with bonus; Aggregate score: 100.08%)
- [x] Week 2: elementary sort (all 3 quiz)
- [x] Week 3: merge sort (all 3 quiz, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score; Aggregate score: 100%)
- [x] Week 3: quick sort (all 3 quiz)
- [x] Week 4: priority queue (all 3 quiz, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score with solve 4x4-49; Aggregate score: 100%)
- [x] Week 4: symbol table (3 quiz)


## Extra Credit
- [x] Week 2: elementary sort: jarvis convex hull algorithm
- [x] Week 4: priority queue: event driven simulation
- [x] Week 4: symbol table: morris preorder
