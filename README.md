## Target
In coursera, I found the quiz part has worst experience.

so I decide to try my best to make up for this deficiency. 

Every Quiz problem, I will build a class and a test to verify the correctness.

## List
- [x] Week 1: union find (all 3 quiz, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score with bonus; Aggregate score: 101.25%)
- [x] Week 1: analysis of alogorithm (all 3 quiz)
- [x] Week 2: stack queue (all 3 quiz, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score with bonus; Aggregate score: 100.08%)
