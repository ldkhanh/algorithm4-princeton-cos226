## Target
In coursera, I found the quiz part has worst experience.

so I decide to try my best to make up for this deficiency. 

Every Quiz problem, I will build a class and a test to verify the correctness.

## List
- [x] Week 1: union find (all 3 quiz, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score with bonus; Aggregate score: 101.25%)
- [x] Week 1: analysis of alogorithm (all 3 quiz)
- [x] Week 2: stack queue (all 3 quiz, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score with bonus; Aggregate score: 100.08%)
- [x] Week 2: elementary sort (all 3 quiz)
- [x] Week 3: merge sort (all 3 quiz, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score; Aggregate score: 100%)
- [x] Week 3: quick sort (all 3 quiz)
- [x] Week 4: priority queue (all 3 quiz, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score with solve 4x4-49; Aggregate score: 100%)
- [x] Week 4: symbol table (3 quiz)
- [x] Week 5: balance search tree (all 3 quiz)
- [x] Week 5: geometric search (4 extra credit, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score without rectHV in node)
- [x] Week 6: hash table (all 2 quiz)
- [x] Week 7: undirected graph (all 3 quiz)
- [x] Week 7: directed graph (all 3 quiz, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score with all bonus; Aggregate score: 106.67%)
- [x] Week 8: minimum spanning tree (all 3 quiz, 1 extra credit)
- [x] Week 8: shortest path (all 3 quiz, 3 extra credit, 1 project with 0 failed, 100 score with all bonus; Aggregate score: 103.53%)
