## Target
In coursera, I found the quiz part is the part with worst experience.

The quiz questions are very excellent, the hint is helpful. 

But there is no judgement and it does not have a solution.

I think there exists some people may block on those quiz. 

And some people have a thought but hard to implement it. 

Some think their idea is correct, but not have test them.

so I decide to try my best to make up for this deficiency. 

Every Quiz problem, I will build a class and a test to verify the correctness.

## List
