/**
 * Cyclic rotations. Two strings ss and tt are cyclic rotations of one another if they have the same length and
 * s consists of a suffix of t followed by a prefix of t. For example, "suffixsort" and "sortsuffix" are cyclic rotations.
 * <p>
 * Given n distinct strings, each of length L, design an algorithm to determine whether there exists a pair of distinct
 * strings that are cyclic rotations of one another. For example, the following list of n = 12 strings of length
 * L = 10 contains exactly one pair of strings ("suffixsort" and "sortsuffix") that are cyclic rotations of one another.
 * <p>
 * The order of growth of the running time should be nL^2
 * (or better) in the worst case. Assume that the alphabet size R is a small constant.
 * <p>
 * Signing bonus. Do it in NnL time in the worst case.
