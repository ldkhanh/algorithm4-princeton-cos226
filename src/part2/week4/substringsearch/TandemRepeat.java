/**
 * Tandem repeat. A tandem repeat of a base string b within a string s is a substring of ss consisting of
 * at least one consecutive copy of the base string b. Given bb and s, design an algorithm to find a tandem repeat of b
 * within s of maximum length. Your algorithm should run in time proportional to M + N,
 * where M is length of bb and N is the length s.
 * <p>
 * For example, if s is "abcabcababcaba" and b is "abcab",
 * then "abcababcab" is the tandem substring of maximum length (2 copies).
