 * Prefix free codes. In data compression, a set of binary strings is if no string is a prefix of another. For example,
 * {01,10,0010,1111} is prefix free, but {01,10,0010,10100} is not because 10 is a prefix of 10100.
 * Design an efficient algorithm to determine if a set of binary strings is prefix-free.
 * The running time of your algorithm should be proportional the number of bits in all of the binary stings.
