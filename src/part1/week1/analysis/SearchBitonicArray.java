/**
 * Search in a bitonic array. An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers
 * followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a bitonic array of n distinct
 * integer values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.
 *
 * Standard version: Use ∼3lgn compares in the worst case.
 * Signing bonus: Use ∼2lgn compares in the worst case (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform
 * fewer than ∼2lgn compares in the worst case).
